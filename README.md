***NOT AN OFFICIAL SUF UPDATE***

***All power tracking should be working, Elipse Bar, Demonic Fury, Chi, Soul Shards, Shadow Orbs, DK Runes***

***PSA: MoP classic has a .toc rename, it's now exactly like retail, because of this when upgrading from SUF 4.3.5-classic, make sure to delete *_vanilla.toc* as this may take higher priority in loading causing some modules to not load correctly**

***This will 100% be removed at the request of the original addon author(s)***

This is **ONLY** for Cata/Mists Classic

I take no credit in the creation/updates to SUF, this is just a fan fix for SUF
- 7/10 update: last version 5.5.05 will be uploaded tonight, this *hopefully* be the final full release for MoP classic

- 7/8 Update:
Known issues:

- Eclipse Power bar & Demonic Fury power bar will list 2 sets of texts in the text setting for adding in power values to the power bar, this is a bug and sadly no way to fix it (as of now) it is blank so it shouldn't add any text. If it does please submit an issue on it and I'll look into again (I tested for hours adding and deleting text and it didn't duplicate but who knows ¯_(ツ)_/¯
- Holy Power (is this a thing in MoP?) if not just uncheck in the player config for paladin
- If you see lots of "Text" under Demonic Fury/Eclipse bar/Rune bar/Totem bar etc, this was a bug with the previous version that kept duplication text for those bars. Only fix I know is to do a profile reset. If you do not want to do this (I don't blame you) just go to each "Text" frame and delete the text there. It should (in theory) save and will be a non issue
Huge thank you to Jordan466 & others who have posted issues, I'm limited to mostly PTR as I don't play classic much if at all

*hopefully everything is correct and I didn't do anything else dumb*
