***NOT AN OFFICIAL SUF UPDATE***

***This will 100% be removed at the request of the original addon author(s)***

This is **ONLY** for Mists

I take no credit in the creation/updates to SUF, this is just a fan fix for SUF

**To Download**
Hit Code and Download Zip, Only the **ShadoedUF_Options & ShadowedUnitFrames** folders should be put into the Interface/Addons folder

7/5 update: Burning Embers and partial Eclipse tracking working.
Working on Shadow Orbs, Chi & Demonic Fury
