***NOT AN OFFICIAL SUF UPDATE***

***All power tracking should be working, Elipse Bar, Demonic Fury, Chi, Soul Shards, Shadow Orbs, DK Runes***

**PSA: MoP classic has a .toc rename, it's now exactly like retail, because of this when upgrading from SUF 4.3.5-classic, make sure to delete *_vanilla.toc* as this may take higher priority in loading causing some modules to not load correctly**

***This will 100% be removed at the request of the original addon author(s)***

This is **ONLY** for Cata/Mists Classic

I take no credit in the creation/updates to SUF, this is just a fan fix for SUF
