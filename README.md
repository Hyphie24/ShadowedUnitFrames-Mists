***NOT AN OFFICIAL SUF UPDATE***

***Loads and works, but not all forms of power tracking working***

***This will 100% be removed at the request of the original addon author(s)***

This is **ONLY** for Mists

I take no credit in the creation/updates to SUF, this is just a fan fix for SUF

**To Download**
Hit Code and Download Zip, Only the **ShadoedUF_Options & ShadowedUnitFrames** folders should be put into the Interface/Addons folder

7/6 update: Back to drawing board. Looks like majority of the code is retail based. I currently have these working 100%

Affliction Warlock Soul Shards
Destruction Warlock Burning Embers
Monk Chi
Monk Stagger (mostly)

Working but some text issues
Warlock Demonic Fury
Druid Eclipse

In Progress
Priest Shadow Orbs - *note to self make sure to actually name the CORRECT POWER!* - 100% working now
